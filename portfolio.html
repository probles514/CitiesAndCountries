  <h2>My First Program</h2>

	<img src="assets/ada-program.jpg"/>

  <p>This is the first ever computer program! It is a diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers. I devised this before the computer was even built!</p>

  <h2>The Analytical Engine</h2>

  <img src="assets/analytical-engine.jpg" />

  <p>This is the first computer ever. It could calculate equations and store up to one kilobyte of memory (a 16 by 16 pixel icon or a page of text). Charles Babbage began its design in the 1830s, but never completed it. We collaborated on many parts of the design and I developed programs for it like the one above.</p>

  <p> Hi, I'm Ada Lovelace, considered one of the first computer programmers ever! But you might be asking yourself - weren’t computers invented in the 1900s?!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> Even though electronic computers were not available during my lifetime, I helped pioneer the first modern computer science concepts. As a child, I showed exceptional talent in mathematics and science. Eventually, my mentor Charles Babbage asked me to translate an article on his invention called the analytical engine, one of the first calculators. In my translation, I added my own commentary on the machine, which became some of the first computer instructions and concepts in history! </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> My instructions included many of the same ideas computer scientists use today - like variables and looping! </p>
